## Overview

Metabolomics closest to the phenotype is shifting to the single-cell level (SCM), which is a powerful tool for studying cellular heterogeneity by providing insight into the differences be-tween individual cells. Because analytical workflow of single-cell metabolomics (SCM) in-cludes various processes, a standardized and transparent pipeline is essential to connect the raw data to biological interpretation especially for non-bioinformatic researchers. However, a uni-fied tool to provide the entire workflow of SCM is still lacking.<br><br>In this study, MMEASE was updated to its 2.0 version by advancing from bulk metabolomics to the single-cell metabolom-ics, which realize a comprehensive analytical workflow of SCM for the first time. Specifically, MMEASE 2.0 is a unique tool in SCM by (a) providing the most comprehensive workflow of data processing, (b) realizing systematical functions of analyzing both metabolic heterogeneity and functional heterogeneity, and (c) significantly enhancing the capability of metabolite an-notation with biological interpretations using tandem spectra.<br><br>In summary, MMEASE 2.0 pro-vides an indispensable online service of whole analytical workflow in SCM. MMEASE 2.0 is freely accessible at <a href="https://idrblab.org/mmease2025/">http://idrblab.org/mmease2025</a>.




## Installation



Install a variety of *R* packages imported in this protocol.

Installed from ***CRAN*** (can also from other repositories): dummies.

Installation commands:

```{r CRAN, eval = FALSE}
CRAN_packages <- c("dummies")
install.packages(CRAN_packages, dependencies = TRUE)
```

Installed from ***Bioconductor*** (can also from other repositories): multtest,mixOmics and ropls.

Installation commands:

```{r Bioconductor, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

Bioconductor_packages <- c("multtest","mixOmics","ropls")

BiocManager::install(Bioconductor_packages, ask = FALSE)
```



Install the `MMEASE` package by running the following command in RStudio:

``` {r banana,eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bananalab3/banana2")
```

## Example Data

You can use the example data provided in `banana` to try it out.

**Example single-cell metabolomic data** ([Download](https://iboalab.cn/mmease2025/MTBLS78_co_culture.csv)): As shown in the sample data, cell name, cell classes, cell types, and batch information are required in the first four columns of the input file. In the following columns, the raw peak intensities across all cells are further provided. Unique metabolite IDs or peaks are listed in the first row of the csv file.



## Usage and Examples

For the usage and examples of `banana`, users can refer to the vignette "How to Use `banana`" built in the package.
